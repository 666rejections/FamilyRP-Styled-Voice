# FamilyRP-Styled-Voice
This repo just puts a circle underneath each person, if they speak it changes the color of the circle underneath them from green to blue. This is basically exactly what FAMILYRP has, expect the colors are different. I used https://forum.fivem.net/t/re-release-id-over-head-version-1-1/48842 as reference in my code.
